    "1.  Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ans:By including functions,Â we can prevent repeating the same code\n",
    "    block repeatedly in a program\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when\n",
    "    it's called?\n",

    "4.  What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ans: A function consists of the def statement and the code in its\n",
    "    def clause. A function call is what moves the program execution into\n",
    "    the function, and the function call evaluates to the function's\n",
    "    return value\n",

    "5.  How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local\n",
    "    scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ans:There is one global scope, and a local scope is created whenever\n",
    "    a function is called\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call\n",
    "    returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ans:When a function returns, the local scope is destroyed, and all\n",
    "    the variables in it will reset.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a\n",
    "    return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ans:A return value is the value that a function call evaluates to.\n",
    "    Like any value, a return value can be used as part of an expression\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return\n",
    "    value of a call to that function?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ans:If there is no return statement for a function, its return value\n",
    "    is None.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ans:A global statement will force a variable in a function to refer\n",
    "    to the global variable\n",
    "\n",

    "    it after importing spam?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ans:This function can be called with spam.bacon()\n",

    "    Ans:Place the line of code that might cause an error in a try\n",
    "    clause.\n",

    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the\n",
    "    except clause?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ans:The code that could potentially cause an error goes in the try\n",
    "    clause. -The code that executes if an error happens goes in the\n",
